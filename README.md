Memory problems? Use your PC!

*This has been successfully tested on 32-Bit Windows 7.*

When you're thinking of something, type it out in Notepad. Keep saving it to your Desktop. Store everything you need to remember on your PC's Desktop. When you're ready to "remember" everything, delete the stuff you no longer need and then launch the "remember.bat" file. A *Memory* folder will be instantly created on your Desktop - which everything is moved to. The first time you run it, you will see a sub-folder named "0" in your Memory folder. The second time, you will see a sub-folder named "1". And the third time, a sub-folder named "2", etc. You will never forget anything.

Be aware though that your Desktop displays the contents of more than just one folder. The two main folders are:

1.	This is your Desktop folder:

		C:\Users\<name>\Desktop

2.	This is your Public Desktop folder:

		C:\Users\Public\Desktop

Only the contents of your <name> folder will be moved. The contents of your Public Desktop folder will remain where they are.
